# Byte-Busters
Deceptive subscriptions and Dark UX patterns.
1.Audit the flows for confusion, hidden costs, and forced choices.

2.Make pricing, renewal, and cancellation immediately obvious.

3.Add clear microcopy, frictionless cancellation, and obvious opt-ins (no pre-checked boxes).

4.Monitor refunds, cancellations, and “help” searches to catch problems early.

5.Ship policy + training so product/design/marketing stop doing shady stuff
